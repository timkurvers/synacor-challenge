JavaScript / ES6+ virtual machine for https://challenge.synacor.com.

The [architecture spec] is bundled in this repository.

See [synacor-binja-plugin] for a [Binary Ninja] plugin capable of analyzing Synacor programs.

## Setup

Install [Node.js] 12 or higher for your platform.

Install dependencies through npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running VM

To run a program (from the `programs`-folder) in the VM:

```bash
npm start programs/alphabet.synbin
```

### Scenarios

Rather than typing in user input or commands manually, a scenario can be fed
directly via `stdin`:

```shell
cat scenarios/challenge.txt - | npm run start programs/challenge.synbin
```

Note: `-` is required to ensure the VM does not terminate after the scenario is
exhausted, but rather stays alive and accepts further input.

### Debug commands

Whenever the program in the VM is awaiting input or the debugger is interrupted,
commands prefixed with `$` are executed as JavaScript code using [eval].

Use this to easily inspect and mutate program state:

```
$ registers
[
  25975, 25974, 26006,
      0,   101,     0,
      0,     0
]

$ address = 0xa0a
2570
```

For convenience the `hex` and `hexoffset` helpers are also available:

```
$ hexoffset(address)
0xa0a
```

To dump raw memory for the current program for analysis:

```
$ dump()
raw memory dumped to: programs/challenge-20200618T223617810Z.synbin
```

## External Debugging

Debuggers like `gdb` do not support arbitrary architectures like Synacor out of
the box.

However, by piggybacking on the [GDB remote protocol] and replicating packets
sent back and forth we can trick `gdb` into happily controlling a Synacor program
whilst running in a JavaScript VM within a Node.js process. ðŸ¤¯

Features supported:

- Breakpoints (`break`)
- Control flow (stepping using `stepi` and `continue`)

To debug a program and listen for "remote gdb" connections on `localhost:31337`:

```bash
npm run debug programs/alphabet.synbin
```

Fire up `gdb` in a separate shell and attach to the remote target:

```bash
(gdb) target remote :31337
Remote debugging using :31337
0x00000000 in ?? ()
(gdb) b *0x2a
Breakpoint 1 at 0x2a

(gdb) stepi
0x00000004 in ?? ()

(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, 0x0000002a in ?? ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Program terminated with signal SIGTERM, Terminated.
```

The debugger allows interrupting a running program by sending Ctrl+C from `gdb`:

```bash
(gdb) c
Continuing.
^C
Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
0x00002f44 in ?? ()
```

### Binary Ninja

See [synacor-binja-plugin] for debugging Synacor programs using [Binary Ninja].

### Options

To listen on a different host/port use `GDB_HOST` and `GDB_PORT`:

```bash
GDB_HOST=customhost GDB_PORT=1337 npm run debug programs/alphabet.synbin
```

To log all GDB remote protocol traffic use `GDB_LOG`:

```bash
GDB_LOG= npm run debug programs/alphabet.synbin
```

## Development

To monitor code changes and re-run programs in the VM during development:

```bash
npm run start:dev programs/alphabet.synbin
```

Similary, for the debugger during development:

```bash
npm run debug:dev programs/alphabet.synbin
```
